          his hometown, the metropolitan Shanghai. Ding’s practice encompasses painting, sculpture, spatial installation
          and architecture. They have been exhibited worldwide including the 1993 Venice Binnale, and held in private

          New York University. Having spent many years in China since 1980, she is an expert in China’s modern history.
          Her work to date has explored the intersections of Chinese intellectual-cultural history, global change, and
          conceptual histories so as to understand the ways in which China’s violent integration into the global
          capitalist world system of economics, culture, and society transformed China and the world from the
          late-nineteenth century onwards. She also is a committed translator of historical and contemporary Chinese
          intellectual work into English. One of her most famous publication is Mao Zedong and China in the
          Twentieth-Century World: A Concise History (Duke 2010). She situates Mao and the revolution in a global
          setting informed by imperialism, decolonization, and third worldism, and discusses worldwide trends in
          politics, the economy, military power, and territorial sovereignty. The book was translated and published in
          mainland China in 2013 and received popular acclaim among Chinese readers. In co-editing The Birth of Chinese
          Feminism: Essential Texts in Transnational Theory (with L. Liu and D. Ko, Columbia 2013), she introduces to an
          English-language audience the little-known anarchist-feminist from early-20th century China, He-Yin Zhen,

        <p>Wang Shu, Chinese architect and founder of Amateur Architecture Studio, has been just announced as the
          recipient of the 2012 Pritzker Prize.
          The Pritzker Prize’s purpose is “to honor a living architect whose built work demonstrates a combination of
          those qualities of talent, vision, and commitment, which has produced consistent and significant contributions
          to humanity and the built environment through the art of architecture”.
          In my opinion Wang Shu’s architecture presents a contemporary and progressive approach that acknowledges the
          rich tradition of Chinese architecture. As the future generations of Chinese architects are influenced by his
          architecture, a generation that will be an active part of China’s growth, he will indirectly improve how
          millions will live in the next few years.
          He calls his office Amateur Architecture Studio, but the work is that of a virtuoso in full command of the
          instruments of architecture — form, scale, material, space and light - Karen Stein, Pritzker Prize jury.

                      <p>With the development of informatization and economic globalization, city clusters have become
                        the mainstream trend of global urbanization : the development of megalopolises has blurred city
                        boundaries and increased the mobility of population and resources; however, it has also led to
                        uneven development between cities, high degrees of industrial homogeneity, and internal
                        friction.
                        Take the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Great Bay Area, which has the most dynamic economy in China,
                        as an example: the development of individual cities show a staggered distribution pattern with
                        Guangzhou and Shenzhen in the lead. Under the policy of promoting sustainable urban development
                        through the construction of megalopolises, how should cooperation and competition between cities
                        be coordinated so that each city benefits from another's development? In the process of policy
                        implementation, how can obstacles and resistant forces be overcome?</p>

                      <p>Starting from the end of 2019, the new coronavirus created a tremendous challenge to China's
                        medical system within three months. With more than ten thousand infections and thousands of
                        deaths in China, this unprecedented disaster allowed us to witness medical staff's
                        round-the-clock persistence and the difficulties faced by medical companies, but also exposed
                        the inadequacy of the medical system.

                        Now that the domestic epidemic in China has passed its peak, how should we improve the existing
                        medical system, enhance the capacities of local medical facilities, accelerate public health
                        policy reform, and better respond to future challenges? In order to further empower the medical
                        system with technology, what roles will private companies play in the future?</p>

                      <p>Due to complexities in the current global situation and adverse impacts of the pandemic on the
                        domestic economy, the macroeconomic policies formulated by the central government is actively
                        pursuing changes and projecting them into technology, domestic consumption, and finance. The
                        government has repeatedly emphasizes the importance of accelerating progress for 'new
                        infrastructure construction' projects such as artificial intelligence, 5G internet, cloud
                        computing, and big data: by mid-2020, "new infrastructure" investments will reach 1 trillion
                        yuan. This is not only the the current policy focal point for boosting short-term growth in
                        light of the pandemic, but also the foundation for future economic construction and the driving
                        force behind long-term economic development. It is estimated that in the next five years, the
                        digital transformation brought about by 5G networks will drive 15.2 trillion yuan in economic
                        growth, and the expansion of artificial intelligence technology will also drive the growth of
                        related industries by 4 trillion yuan. What opportunities will new patterns in China's economic
                        development bring to "new infrastructure"? In the face of global economic recession, how can
                        “new infrastructure” construction, a term bound up in our current times, support the prosperity
                        and development of China's economy and society in the next 20 years?
                        As the pioneer of digital transformation, digital technology will further empower the financial
                        industry in aspects such as data intelligence. How will the financial industry benefit from the
                        development of new infrastructure in all aspects? Under the great wave of economic digitization,
                        how can the financial industry better grasp the opportunities brought by the "new
                        infrastructure"? In the field of science and technology, the development of future cities will
                        benefit from the technological achievements brought about by new infrastructure to realize the
                        blueprint of smart cities. How should science and technology companies integrate technological
                        innovation to create urban organic life, so that investment in "new infrastructure" can land in
                        business scenarios and be used to build a better urban ecology?</p>

                      <p>Since the Ministry of Education issued the "Education Informatization Development Plan
                        2011-2020" in 2012, the government has coordinated civil society forces to actively participate
                        in educational informatization and industrialization, so that full use of information technology
                        can be made to achieve sharing of high-quality educational resources, improve quality, and build
                        a society founded in learning. From 2012 to 2018, China's education informatization expenditures
                        increased from 117.9 billion yuan to 313.2 billion yuan, and the national primary and secondary
                        internet access rate also increased from 25% to 96%. Not only that, the "Education
                        Informatization 2.0 Action Plan" document issued by the Ministry of Education in 2018 further
                        requires active promotion of "Internet+ Education" development, in order to build a society
                        where all citizens have the capacity to study and access to education resources anywhere and
                        anytime, founded in an internet-based, digital, intelligent, personalized, and lifelong
                        education system.

                        In the past ten years, the country has continuously promoted the reform and development of
                        modern digitalization, and the education sectors have also changed. At present, what challenges
                        are still facing education informatization as a solution to uneven distribution of urban and
                        rural educational resources? Can the "digital highway" constructed by 5G technology promote the
                        application of AI, VR/AR and other technologies in the education field, so that China's
                        education will develop in the direction of informatization and individualization? En route to
                        future educational reform, how can companies and institutions grasp the trend of smart
                        education, achieve cultural integration, and participate in the construction and optimization of
                        an education system with Chinese characteristics?</p>

                      <p>Since the outbreak of the pandemic, various industries have suffered heavy losses, and the
                        cultural and entertainment industries have not escaped the shock: film and television companies
                        have ceased operations, production crews have paused projects, variety shows have stopped
                        filming, and large numbers of entertainment productions have been suspended.

                        As people return to creating and disseminating culture and entertainment after the pandemic's
                        peak, the industry itself is also experiencing an awakening, marking an important turning point
                        for investigating the lasting value of various textual products. In the face of fierce
                        competition, many online video platforms are building intellectual property in depth, trying to
                        create a new industry ecology more in line with users' needs; in the context of policy guidance
                        and industry self-discipline, the trend of cheap absurdism (雷剧leiju) in popular TV has been
                        curbed, and a large number of film and television creators hope to build deeper emotional
                        connections with the audience, and stimulate thinking under the context of entertainment, so as
                        to create high-quality content with both entertainment value and social significance. In the era
                        of multimedia integration, practitioners are also constantly exploring new ways of dissemination
                        with online and offline combinations.

                        The epidemic is accelerating structural adjustments and integrated developments in the
                        entertainment industry. In the future, what will be the industry's layout? What expectations
                        does the public have for the future of the entertainment industry? Will the entire entertainment
                        industry enter a new normal?</p>

                      <p>Public health is one of the most conspicuous global challenges. As Constitution of WHO states,
                        “Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence
                        of disease or infirmity”. It is a primary concern to many developing countries as to how to
                        guarantee the physical and mental health of their populations while sustaining economic growth.
                        <br /><br />Public health in China regards the interests of nearly 1.4 billion population as
                        well as the nation’s sustainable development. Chinese government has been making continuous
                        efforts to deepen medical and health reforms and to promote departmental administrative
                        integration in such fields as population and health. Meanwhile, however, new public health
                        issues, such as hospice care, occupational diseases and poverty, and AIDS, constantly pose new
                        challenges to the public health system. Public health as a public good, we believe, demands
                        concerted collaboration among government, social organisations, and research institutions etc.
                        to achieve synthesis of both resources and policies. The Public Health Panel therefore invites
                        distinguished guests, who have contributed to public health development in their professional
                        capacity in different sectors, to exchange their understandings of medical and health reforms
                        and of prominent issues in public health in China.

                      <p>Thanks to the continuous efforts of translators and academic facilitators, contemporary Chinese
                        literature has gradually grown to be one of the major forces in world literature today. As the
                        publishing industries continue to thrive in multiple Chinese-speaking societies, the variety of
                        literary outputs has developed at an exponential rate, and the success of this expansion has
                        been testified in recent years by the numerous international literary prizes awarded to Chinese
                        writers and their translators. However, the male intellectual tradition from the Republican era
                        still holds strongly in the contemporary Chinese literary scene and women’s issues and voices
                        are often sidelined or given tokenistic treatment. <br /><br />With these challenges in mind,
                        our literature panel this year presents to you four excellent cultural workers from different
                        backgrounds, including fiction, academia, journalism, and translation. In their works or
                        experiences, women’s welfare and representation have always been some of the major concerns, and
                        together they will discuss how gender affects the development of Chinese literature, especially
                        in the years to come.</p>

                      <p>Just a mere decade ago, the thought that China could even come close to the technological
                        forefront would seem outlandish. Not anymore. Home to two world-class tech giants Tencent and
                        Alibaba, equipped with the world’s largest online payments market, and as the only country to
                        record a double-digit growth in patent applications as well as accounting for 20% of total world
                        R&amp;D expenditure, China’s sudden technological rise has left the world in awe. What has
                        caused such a dramatic transformation? Are there any potential pitfalls in China’s continued
                        growth? And finally, is China on its way to becoming the next tech leader? <br /><br />Through
                        engaging Chinese and Western tech entrepreneurs, alongside policy researchers and scholars in a
                        round table discussion, this panel aims to shed light on the past and future of China’s path to
                        technological dominance.</p>

                        feminists” alike, have constructed a new discourse of “Chineserural feminists中华田园女权” criticising

                        benefits. Asarguedby Li Xiaojiang(2004), rather than situating Chinese feminism in
                        anantagonisticstance against the state and market, it shall be put within the contextof
                        development. <br /><br />However, how shall we understand Chinese feminism in themesh of
                        socialism, market economy and the digital age which augmentsconsumerism,self-construction, and

                      <p>Globalisation faces mounting pressure from all sides. The US used to champion the idea of a
                        global village but now pursues an “American First” approach under the Trump administration. The
                        world today is witnessing insufficient drive for economic growth, a widening wealth gap and the
                        spread of nonconventional security threats like terrorism, and cybercrime. These challenges
                        require global solutions. <br /><br />It is widely believed that China has become the most
                        important advocate and practitioner of globalisation in the world. The phrase &quot;building a
                        community with a shared future for mankind&quot; is a concept constantly mentioned by Chinese
                        President Xi Jinping both at home and abroad. In 2017, it was written in the report of the 19th
                        CCP party congress and became part of the guideline for Chinese diplomacy. The Belt and Road
                        Initiative is one way of putting the concept into practice. President Xi believes that the
                        initiative will become a significant platform for countries concerned to realise their common
                        development through cooperation. <br /><br />How should we interpret the concept of
                        &quot;building a community with a shared future for mankind”? To what extent will the concept
                        influence Sino-European relations? How will Sino-European relation develop in the context of
                        transnational crises in Europe?</p>

                      <p>The modern history of China is marked by strenuous efforts on the part of Chinese intellectuals
                        to recover a strong and prosperous China out of poverty and corruption. One of the central
                        questions in the debate is how to deal with the legacy of Confucianism. In their confrontation
                        with the West, the Chinese indeed tried a wide range of social experiments including Qing
                        China’s ‘Eastern Ways, Western Technologies’ and Mao’s Great Leap Forward and Culture
                        Revolution, which brought about devastating effects on Chinese society. <br /><br />After four
                        decades of reform, China is still struggling to accommodate and learn from Confucianism, a
                        living legacy that has, over hundreds of years, seen China’s ups and downs. Confucian moral
                        values continue to shape the hurly-burly of daily life in China and the ideal of finding a
                        benevolent leader governing the country still hovers around Chinese politics. Confucianism,
                        however, also needs to confront many challenges issuing from the modern era—the challenges of
                        the rule of law, of democracy and of human rights. <br /><br />What varieties of Confucianism
                        can we render intelligible in the contemporary Chinese context? And what can China learn from
                        the social and political experience of the pan-Confucian world such as South Korea, Taiwan and
                        Singapore? In addressing these questions, the philosophy panel will deliver insights from top
                        political theorists and Confucian philosophers in the world today.</p>

                      <p>This year, the Rural China Panel will focus on the topic “Rural Chinese Society: The Future of
                        the Next Generation”. We would like to explore how urbanisation and modernisation have affected
                        the diminishing rural population and what challenges the new generation of rural China faces. We
                        have always believed that the discussion on rural Chinese society should be a significant theme
                        in the narrative of modern China. On the one hand, rural Chinese society is a link to the past
                        Chinese traditions and culture. On the other hand, rural China is also the source of potential
                        problems and change. <br /><br />Following the open-up of the Chinese economy and the
                        marketisation in late 1980s, various social issues surge forward. Urban migration, aged
                        population in the countryside, education for children in rural China, transportation safety are
                        all imminent problems waiting to be solved. The future developmental path of rural China will
                        crucially influence a number of socio-political concerns, such as urban-rural inequality,
                        political freedom, democratic elections, etc. Bearing all these in mind, we hope that through
                        our panel discussion we are able to find a way which can lead rural Chinese society to a
                        prosperous future.</p>

                      <p>For the first time in Oxford China Forum’s history, we are offering a literature panel. China’s
                        literature today face unique challenges. The proliferation of new social media platforms
                        combined with the old censorship regime invites the question of how we can build and sustain
                        literary high culture in China. Globalising Chinese literature is oftentimes barred by
                        difficulties in achieving precise and elegant translation. <br /><br />Is accessibility for the
                        audience overseas a concern for Chinese writers in their writing today? Are media adaptations of
                        literature distracting or attracting the audience in terms of sustained interest in quality
                        reading? How relevant are topics in identity politics in today's China? Is the country really at
                        the forefront of the postmodern marketisation of culture? We invite you to explore these
                        questions with our distinguished guests from the academia and literature related industries.</p>

                      <p>The Art &amp; Culture panel will be themed around ‘Reinvention and Revival’. This panel is
                        specially designed for interdisciplinary discussions on Chinese art and culture, from the
                        perspective of all kinds of artists, including dancers, calligraphers, writers and painters. The
                        multi-cultural and multi-disciplinary backgrounds of our distinguished guests will hopefully
                        inject the discussions with vibrancy and refreshing ideas. The last one hundred years saw art
                        and culture in China challenged from multiple fronts. Whilst the influx of Western art and
                        aestheticism stimulated change and adaption, the growing economy and expanding market raised the
                        issue of commercialisation. Attempts were made to recovered the lost tradition, while
                        reinvention was also actively sought. <br /><br />In this panel discussion, we will be exploring
                        the transformation of Chinese art in the last century, the way it echoes with Western culture,
                        and the underlying social current that influenced the realm of art profoundly. We will also look
                        into the tension between materialism and idealism, and between westernisation and the
                        traditionalist approach.</p>

                      <p>This year the technology panel will be exploring the topic ‘Artificial Intelligence and the
                        Future of Work’. AI is in the news almost every day. It has been described as ‘the new
                        electricity’, which will revolutionise industries from automotive to manufacturing to
                        healthcare. Cities are getting smarter, cars are driving themselves, online customer service
                        robots can answer questions and artificial intelligence is helping doctors to detect disease
                        more accurately. China has been taking a leading role in the development of AI. Last year China
                        received one third of the world's AI funding, published more articles on deep learning than the
                        US and grew to host 23% of the world's AI companies. Innovative products such as mobile
                        payments, e-commerce delivery, autonomous cars and the sharing economy are shaping China's
                        economy and driving rapid growth. <br /><br />We do not yet know how AI will affect the
                        workforce or the extent to which AI will come to shape our lives. Should we worry about
                        technological unemployment, the way John Maynard Keynes did in the 1930s or the Luddites did in
                        the 19th century? History would suggest that such concerns are foolhardy. What we do know is
                        that there is a stark difference in the Western and Eastern attitudes to AI which affect the way
                        AI is governed. An increasingly bipolar AI landscape will also have implications for
                        geopolitics. In this panel, we will discuss the frontier of China’s AI industry, attitudes to AI
                        in China and how AI might affect the global economy and balance of power.</p>

                      <p>Ever since China’s economic reforms in the 1980s, the private sector has been playing an
                        increasingly crucial role in the country’s economy, resulting in a tremendous boost of its GDP
                        and immense transformation in Chinese people’s life. However, as manufacturing – the main engine
                        of China’s growth – seems to approach its ceiling, innovation now becomes the new crux of
                        entrepreneurship. While entrepreneurs embark upon this new stage of their long march, not only
                        need they keep up with technological development and changes in consumer mentality, but they
                        also have to deal with international competition, market rules and their social responsibility.
                        <br /><br />With speakers from backgrounds of venture capital, biotechnology, asset management
                        and media industry, the Entrepreneurship Panel will be looking into difficulties that fledgling
                        Chinese companies face in common and factors that contribute to their innovation. The panel will
                        also examine the role of entrepreneurship in social reforms and resources allocation, especially
                        in the light of the Chinese economy’s ‘new norm’.
